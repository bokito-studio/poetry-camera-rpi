# Poetry Camera

A camera that prints poems of what it sees.

We started this project as newcomers to the world of hobby electronics. The following instructions are intended for complete beginners, as we were. We simplified some of the design to optimize for easily sourcing and assembling parts; as a result, it's less compact than our photographed versions. If you are comfortable with electronics and coding, we encourage you to experiment and remix even more.

These instructions are still in progress. Try it out and let us know what's confusing, or doesn't work. We are also looking for help on improving the battery design.

## Hardware you'll need

### 1. Computer: [Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/) with headers

Raspberry Pis are simplified computers. They are lightweight, cheap, have limited processing power, and are more fragile than typical consumer electronic devices. It's very sensitive to the specific power sources you use — too much power and you'll fry the part, too little power and the software won't run. You also have to manually shut down the software before unplugging the power, to protect the software from being corrupted.

We chose the Pi Zero 2 for its balance of processing power (Pi Zeros are too slow) and compact size (most other Pis on the market are larger). The wire diagrams in this tutorial will apply to all Raspberry Pis, but there may be differences in software and camera compatibility, especially with older devices. We've tested this with a [Pi 3b+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) and it works fine, but a [Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) probably requires too much power to make it a viable portable solution.

Raspberry Pi Zero 2 is often sold without headers (those 2x20 black metal connectors). The headers let you easily connect the Pi to the printer and buttons with plug-in jumper wires. If you buy the Pi without headers, you'll need to separately buy a [2x20 header](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2822) and solder them on yourself. It's not hard, but leaves more room for error. (Of course, if you know what you're doing, you can directly solder the appropriate wires to the appropriate pins without headers.)

Raspberry Pis are also recovering from a supply shortage. Check [rpilocator.com](https://rpilocator.com/) for live stock notifications on standalone parts (does not list accessory kits).

### 2. Accessories to connect the Raspberry Pi to stuff.

  - [Vilros sells a kit that includes all of these things](https://vilros.com/products/vilros-raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-basic-starter-kit)
    - [5V MicroUSB power supply](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Supply-Adapter-Listed/dp/B00MARDJZ4) 
    - [Case](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2258)
    - [32GB MicroSD card to load the OS](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-sd-card-noobs.html)
    - Heatsink to prevent overheating (very important!)
    - MicroUSB to USB adapter, for the Logitech keyboard's wireless sensor.
    - MiniHDMI to HDMI adapter for monitor
  - **Keyboard & mouse**: we recommend [this Logitech wireless combo keyboard-trackpad](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Keyboard-Touchpad-PC-connected-dp-B014EUQOGK/dp/B014EUQOGK) so it only takes up 1 port of your Pi.
  - **External monitor** for viewing and programming the Pi's software. It's not strictly required, but is more beginner-friendly than SSHing into your Pi. We will assume that you are using an external monitor for all these instructions.
  
    
### 3. Camera: [Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-3/)
  <img src="https://github.com/carolynz/poetry-camera-rpi/assets/1395087/4fad7574-2933-448f-a556-d0d7990596ec" width="200">

Mostly straightforward, but be careful of damaging the hardware. The Raspberry Pi camera is delicate and can be easily fried via static. We broke 3 cameras in the process of making this project. Just make sure to always store it in a static-shielding bag when you're not using it.

If you are connecting the camera to a Pi Zero 2, note that the Zero 2's camera connection collar is also very delicate. We broke a Pi Zero 2 camera collar in the process of making this as well and had to just get a new Pi 🥲

We have not tested these instructions with older models of Raspberry Pi cameras.

- **Camera accessories:**
  - [Camera case with tripod](https://www.amazon.com/Arducam-Raspberry-Bundle-Autofocus-Lightweight/dp/B09TKYXZFG) — Helps proteect the delicate camera hardware during development.
  - [Camera cable sized specifically for Pi Zero & Zero 2](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3157) — If you are using a larger Pi, you only need default cable that comes with the camera. If you got your Zero 2 camera cable in a kit, it is likely the short ~2 inch cable. Make sure to get a long enough cable that gives you more flexibility in where you place your camera.
  - Optional: Tweezer for opening/closing the delicate camera collar on Pi Zero 2

### 4. Receipt printer: [Mini Thermal Printer w/ TTL Serial connection](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2752)

<img src="https://github.com/carolynz/poetry-camera-rpi/assets/1395087/209bbe14-b494-4826-8851-61561f4f34ac" width="300">

We used the Adafruit thermal printer line for this project, but they have subsequently been discontinued. Similar products exist on Amazon; we are working on confirming that they still work with the same printer drivers (which are also no longer maintained by Adafruit, but still seem to work).

The important thing is that the thermal printer has a TTL serial connection so you can easily connect it to the Pi.

The [Nano Thermal Printer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2752) or [Thermal Printer Guts](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2753) are more compact, but have slightly different wiring.

- **Receipt printer accessories:**
  - [5V power supply](https://www.adafruit.com/product/276)
  - [Female DC Power Adapter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/368) to connect receipt to power supply
  - Wire cutters, wire stripper, tiny screwdriver for wiring together
  - Receipt paper: [EcoChit thermal receipt paper, 2.25"](https://www.amazon.com/EcoChit-Thermal-Paper-Rolls-Plants/dp/B076MMDL8Y) (phenol-free, recyclable)
    - Don't use regular receipt paper! [It's often filled with BPA](https://environmentaldefence.ca/2019/02/07/toxic-receipt-bpa-thermal-paper/), which is especially toxic for kids and reproductive health.

### 5. Batteries:

Batteries remain a challenge for this project because the Pi and the receipt printer have very different power requirements. You could always just keep Poetry Camera plugged in, but that restricts the amount of interesting photos you could take.

We've heard of people having success with 2x 18620 batteries. We have not tried this yet, but it seems promising.

- Battery for the receipt printer: [6 x AA battery holder with 5.5mm/2.1mm plug](https://www.adafruit.com/product/248) + 6x AA batteries

  <img src="https://github.com/carolynz/poetry-camera-rpi/assets/1395087/b3507b14-3b12-4fbc-99fa-ffc5c589bf93" width="300">
  - The printer needs a 5-9V power source that can handle high current draw while printing. Typical 9V alkaline batteries do *not* work as they do not provide enough current. To keep things simple for assembly, we've separated out the power sources, but it makes things bulkier.

- Battery for the Raspberry Pi:
  - The Pi needs consistent 5V of power in order to function, which standard phone battery packs do not provide, and the PiSugar battery we did find has also occasionally driven it to overheating.

### 6. Buttons

- 2 [push buttons in different colors](https://www.adafruit.com/search?q=16mm%20Panel%20Mount%20Momentary%20Pushbutton)
- 2 [quick-connect wires](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1152) to easily connect these buttons to the Pi

### 7. Miscellaneous equipment

- Wire cutter & stripper
- Jumper cables

## Software

- OpenAI account & API key. Each poem costs a couple cents to generate.

Currently, the `main.py` script running on the Pi:

- Takes a photo when you click the shutter button
- Sends the photo to GPT-4 to create a poem
- Receives an AI-generated poem from OpenAI
- Prints poem out on thermal receipt printer

The `Adafruit_Thermal.py` script is [Adafruit's thermal printer Python library](https://github.com/adafruit/Python-Thermal-Printer).

## How to set up

This was cobbled together from the following tutorials:

- [Instant Camera using Raspberry Pi and Thermal Printer](https://learn.adafruit.com/instant-camera-using-raspberry-pi-and-thermal-printer)
- [Networked Thermal Printer using Raspberry Pi and CUPS](https://learn.adafruit.com/networked-thermal-printer-using-cups-and-raspberry-pi)

1. Set up your Raspberry Pi with Camera connection.

2. Open up the Terminal on your Pi.

3. Set up Raspberry Pi hardware to take Camera & Serial inputs:

```shell
sudo raspi-config
```

4. You'll want to adjust the following settings:

   - Glamor: ON (for Camera setup on newer versions of Raspbian OS)
   - Serial Port ON (lets you access receipt printer inputs)
   - Serial Console OFF (idk what this does)

   Restart the system as needed.

5. Update the system and install requirements. I'm not sure you even need all of these; I can go over these again later and trim out the unnecessary ones.

```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install git cups build-essential libcups2-dev libcupsimage2-dev python3-serial python-pil python-unidecode
```

6. Install some software required to make the Adafruit Thermal Printer work.

```shell
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/adafruit/zj-58
$ cd zj-58
$ make
$ sudo ./install
```

7. Clone this repo, which contains our Poetry Camera software:

```shell
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/carolynz/poetry-camera-rpi.git
```

8. Set up your thermal printer, connecting it to power and your Pi. [See diagram and instructions in this tutorial.](https://learn.adafruit.com/networked-thermal-printer-using-cups-and-raspberry-pi/connect-and-configure-printer)
   Test that it works. Pay attention to your printer's baud rate (e.g. `19200`). We will use this later on.

9. Open our `poetry-camera-rpi` directory:

```shell
$ cd poetry-camera-rpi
```

10. _If_ your printer's baud rate is different from `19200`, open `main.py` and replace that number with your own printer's baud rate:

```shell
# main.py:

# instantiate printer
printer = Adafruit_Thermal('/dev/serial0', 19200, timeout=5)
```

11. Run the poetry camera script.

```shell
$ python main.py
```

## TODO instructions for adding buttons

## TODO instructions for auto-start/shutoff

- Set up a `cron` job to run your python script at startup. First, open your `crontab` file to your default editor:

```shell
$ crontab -e
```

- Then add the following line to your `crontab`, to run the script when you boot up the computer.

```shell
# Run poetry camera script at start
@reboot cd ~/poetry-camera-rpi/ && sudo python main.py >> ~/poetry-camera-rpi/errors.txt 2>&1
```

The `>> {...}errors.txt 2>&1` writes any error messages to `errors.txt` for debugging. A common failure mode is files cannot be found. Make sure that all your filepaths are absolute filepaths and have the right usernames and directory names.

- Reboot the system for this to take effect

```shell
sudo reboot
```

- Try clicking your shutter and power buttons to make sure they're working upon reboot. If they're not working, check your `errors.txt` file.

## Instructions for wifi portal

Follow [this tutorial](https://www.raspberrypi.com/tutorials/host-a-hotel-wifi-hotspot/). There is a Flask app in the `wifi_portal` folder that you can use in place of the one in the tutorial.

**Note: You will need a USB wifi adapter since the internal wifi adapter seems to have issues when trying run in AP-STA mode.**

- Then add the following line to your `crontab`, to run the script when you boot up the computer.

```shell
# Run wifi portal script at start
@reboot cd ~/poetry-camera-rpi/wifi_portal && sudo python app.py >> ~/poetry-camera-rpi/wifi_portal/errors.txt 2>&1
```

The `>> {...}errors.txt 2>&1` writes any error messages to `errors.txt` for debugging. A common failure mode is files cannot be found. Make sure that all your filepaths are absolute filepaths and have the right usernames and directory names.

- Reboot the system for this to take effect

```shell
sudo reboot
```

Lots of errors in these instructions, I'm sure.
